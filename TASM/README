        can be determined by typing VER at the DOS prompt.)

     e. Contents of your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.


2.  INSTALLATION
----------------

  You should read the rest of this README file to get further
  information about this release before you do the installation.

  The Turbo Profiler/INSTALLATION disk contains a program called
  INSTALL.EXE that will assist you with the installation of Turbo
  Profiler 1.01.

  To start the installation, change your current drive to the one
  that has the install program on it and type INSTALL. You will be
  given instructions in a box at the bottom of the screen for each
  prompt. For example, if you are installing from drive A:,
  you type

    A: <Enter>
    INSTALL <Enter>

  If you have difficulty reading the text displayed by the INSTALL
  program, use the /B command-line parameter to force it to use
  black and white colors:

    a:install /B      - Forces INSTALL into BW80 mode

  Specifying the /B parameter may be necessary if you are using an
  LCD screen or a system that has a color graphics adapter and a
  monochrome or composite monitor.

  Notes for installation:

    INSTALL copies all Turbo Profiler files onto your hard disk
    and puts them into subdirectories. The default subdirectories
    are

      Turbo Profiler Directory:                    C:\TPROF
      Examples Subdirectory:                       C:\TPROF

  By default, all files from the distribution disks are placed in
  the Turbo Profiler Directory. If you would rather separate the
  example programs into their own subdirectory, edit the default
  example files path before selecting START INSTALLATION.

  The Turbo Profiler distribution disks contain several files
  with a .ZIP file extension: TPROF.ZIP, TFEXMPL.ZIP, etc. These
  files contain one or more other files that have been compressed
  and placed inside an archive. You can de-archive them yourself
  by using the UNZIP.EXE utility. For example,

    unzip /o tfexmpl

  unpacks all the files stored in the TFEXMPL.ZIP archive into the
  current directory.

  INSTALL gives you a choice of copying the .ZIP files intact or
  de-archiving and copying all the individual files onto your hard
  disk during the installation process.


3.  NOTES AND RESTRICTIONS
--------------------------
o You need to set the files directive in your CONFIG.SYS file to
  at least FILES = 10, preferably FILES = 20. If you have trouble
  doing the File|DOS Shell command or if TPROF can't find your
  source modules, make sure the FILES directive is in your
  CONFIG.SYS.

o A single Ctrl-Break inside a DOS function call waiting for
  console input will not interrupt DOS and return control to Turbo
  Profiler. You can either press Ctrl-Break once and then end the
  console input function by pressing Enter, or press Ctrl-Break
  twice. You will then interrupt DOS and Turbo Profiler will bring
  up a Disassembly Viewer showing code inside DOS. You should use
  only F9 at this point, possibly after setting an area marker
  inside your program.

o If you are using TF386, make sure that you use the -e option if
  you have loaded any TSRs or device drivers that are using
  extended memory allocated using the VDISK method. The value to
  indicate after the -e is the total amount (in Kbytes) of
  extended memory at the bottom of the extended memory area that
  is being used by other applications before loading TF386. If you
  do not use this option, TF386 may overwrite extended memory that
  is being used by the other applications. For example, if a
  disk-caching program that uses extended memory is loaded and you
  do not use the -e option, the program may write incorrect
  information to your hard disk.

  NOTE: If your programs use the INT 0x15, function 0x88 method
  to allocate memory, DO NOT count this memory, as TF386 will
  automatically leave that memory alone.

o You can set the way display updating is performed using either
  command line options (-do, -dp, -ds) or TFINST (selecting Display
  from its main menu shows the Display Options dialog box).  For both
  methods, user screen updating now defaults to Swap.  You might want
  to select Flip for faster operation; however, this option can cause
  display problems in some circumstances (usually involving
  memory-resident programs' assuming the active display page has
  not changed).  If you set user screen updating to Flip and the
  File|Dos shell command causes display problems, changing back
  to Swap should solve the problem.

o In version 1.01, TFINST contains a new option in the
  Miscellaneous Options dialog box. Link Speed now has a setting
  for 19200 baud.  New command line options controlling baud rate
  in TPROF and TFREMOTE are:
        -rs1      9600 baud (unchanged from version 1.0)
        -rs2     19200 baud (new)
        -rs3     38400 baud (previously -rs2)
        -rs4    115000 baud (default, previously -rs3)

o In version 1.01, the default setting for the NMI intercept is
  OFF. If you are using a hardware debugging board, you might need
  to turn this option on. Use caution, however, as several types
  of machines have incompatibilities that might cause mysterious
  crashes, possibly causing loss of data in memory or on disk. If
  you are using a Tandy 1000, we strongly recommended that you
  leave the NMI intercept off.

o If you're getting erratic behavior, such as messages like
  "Unknown control point", try removing any mouse drivers and
  ram-resident programs you might be running in order to see if
  there is a software conflict.

o If you are using TF386, and you are receiving a "not enough
  memory to load symbol table" message, you need to enable EMS
  emulation for TF386.  To do this, use the -F option. For
  instance, to set up EMS for TF386 at segment 0D000h, invoke
  TF386 with "-FD000".

o If you are using an HP-Vectra, and you get an Unexpected Interrupt
  06 when trying to run TF386, you need to set an option in the
  CMOS setup.  By default the Vectra series uses a protected mode
  instruction as part of the HP-HIL.  To work around this, contact
  Hewlett Packard for instruction on disabling this function.

o If you get a "Cannot run TF386: Processor is already in V8086
  mode" error message when trying to load TF386, then you are
  using a program which uses the virtual mode of the 80386 ( such
  as QEMM ).  At this time, it is not possible to use these
  programs and TF386 at the same time.  You should remove such
  memory managers, re-boot your system and then run TF386.

o If you're having problems with the mouse cursor disappearing or
  behaving erratically, you probably need an updated version of your
  mouse driver.  Because Turbo Debugger 2.01 demands more from the
  mouse driver than most previous programs, you might not experience
  a problem with your current driver until you use Turbo Debugger 2.01.

  At this time, the current major mouse driver revisions are:

        Logitech        4.10
        Genius          9.03
        Microsoft       7.04

  Contact the manufacturer of your mouse for information about
  obtaining a newer version.


4.  ABOUT TURBO PROFILER 1.01
-----------------------------
o Turbo Profiler has been designed to work with other Borland
  language products as well as programs compiled by other vendors.
  Please see the MANUAL.DOC file on the Turbo Debugger distribution
  disks for more information about the TDMAP and TDCONVRT
  utilities. These utilities allow you to compile your programs
  with other languages and then convert them to Turbo Profiler
  format. Turbo Profiler works with the following versions of
  Borland languages:

    TASM 1.0         (or later)
    Turbo C 2.0
    Turbo C++
    Turbo Pascal 5.0 (or later)

o The file HELPME!.DOC on the distribution disks has more
  information about using the mouse capabilities of Turbo
  Profiler 1.01.

o TFINST has the option to set a user-defined program interrupt
  key that is not reflected in the user's manual.
